      <h1>Flight Manual</h1>
      <p class="subheading">
        A simple CSS style for making things look like old school NASA flight manuals, because, honestly, what's cooler than old school NASA?
      </p>

      <section>
        <h1>General Look and Feel</h1>

        <div class="row">
          <p>
            The look and feel of <em>Flight Manual</em> is inspired by Spotify's
            <a href="https://spotify.github.io/apollo/">Apollo Website</a>, and
            old NASA flight manuals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because I don't have much actual content right now, everything that
            follows is almost entirely filler text. At some point
            <em>Flight Manual</em> will be used to actually do something, but,
            unfortunately, that time is not right now.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Flight Manual</strong> is still being worked on, and nowhere
            near complete. If you're interested in using it, or following along
            with its development, you can find the
            <a href="https://github.com/dkuntz2/flight_manual">source on GitHub</a>.

        <h1>Nonsense Text</h1>

        <div class="row">
          <p>"The mind of the Princess of Helium whom I have examined and questioned was a blank to me, she has perfect control, and I could not read one iota of it.  She said that she witnessed a portion of the encounter, and that when she looked there was but one man engaged with the guardsmen; a man whom she did not recognize as ever having seen."</p>

          <p>"Where is my erstwhile savior?" spoke another of the party, and I recognized the voice of the cousin of Than Kosis, whom I had rescued from the green warriors.  "By the metal of my first ancestor," he went on, "but the description fits him to perfection, especially as to his fighting ability."</p>

          <p>"Where is this man?" cried Than Kosis.  "Have him brought to me at once.  What know you of him, cousin?  It seemed strange to me now that I think upon it that there should have been such a fighting man in Zodanga, of whose name, even, we were ignorant before today.  And his name too, John Carter, who ever heard of such a name upon Barsoom!"</p>

          <p>Word was soon broht that I was nowhere to be found, either in the palace or at my former quarters in the barracks of the air-scout squadron.  Kantos Kan, they had found and questioned, but he knew nothing of my whereabouts, and as to my past, he had told them he knew as little, since he had but recently met me during our captivity among the Warhoons.</p>
